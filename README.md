# Portfolio-Website
A beginner portfolio project for learning html, css, js.
 
This portfolio concludes the skill that I have after 1 year of majoring in Computer Science at BINUS University.
The work area of this portfolio is just a template and none of it is changed to my work experience. The same goes for the bento items or completed projects.
The AI chatbot is also still unavailable and is currently under development.

That concludes all the information that I want to share about this project.
