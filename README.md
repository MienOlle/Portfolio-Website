# Portfolio-Website
 A beginner portfolio project for learning html, css, js.
 
 This portfolio concludes the skill that I have after 1 year of learning new things.
 The work area of this portfolio is just a template and none of it is changed to my work experience
 The same goes for the bento items or completed projects.
The AI chatbot is also still unavailable since the OpenAI requires me to spend some money on it and I don't want to spend anything or give out my card number.

That concludes all the information that I want to share about this project.
